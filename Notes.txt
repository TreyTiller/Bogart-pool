The Bogart Community Club was established in 1970 in an effort to give families an affordable place to cool off in the summer.  Forty-four years later we are still following the original intentions of our founders.  The Bogart Pool is owned and maintained by the permanent members.  Each year a limited number of Permanent Memberships and Summer Memberships are available.  Members are expected to conduct themselves appropriately and in accordance with the Club By-Laws. If you are looking for a family friendly and relaxed place to cool off in the summer we welcome you to fill out an application for membership.  Summer Memberships are $385 for the 2020 season. 

Please use the application at right to apply for membership. Once you receive an email that your membership is approved, you can pay your dues here. 

If you have any questions, please contact us at bogartpool19@gmail.com
