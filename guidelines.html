          <p>Parties are limited to no more than 20 swimming guests. Parents or guests who are not swimming do not need to be counted in the 20 guests.  This is out of respect to our members.</p>
          <p>Parties that are too large tend to infringe on our members' enjoyment of the pool because they tend to create a different atmosphere.</p>
            <p>POOL HOURS: 10am-9pm</p>
